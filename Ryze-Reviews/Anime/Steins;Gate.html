                <b>Synopsis</b>
                <hr>
                <p>The self-proclaimed mad scientist Rintarou Okabe rents out a room in a rickety old building in Akihabara, 
                    where he indulges himself in his hobby of inventing prospective "future gadgets" with fellow lab members: 
                    Mayuri Shiina, his air-headed childhood friend, and Hashida Itaru, a perverted hacker nicknamed "Daru." 
                    The three pass the time by tinkering with their most promising contraption yet, a machine dubbed the 
                    "Phone Microwave," which performs the strange function of morphing bananas into piles of green gel.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Though miraculous in itself, the phenomenon doesn't provide anything concrete in Okabe's search for a 
                    scientific breakthrough; that is, until the lab members are spurred into action by a string of mysterious 
                    happenings before stumbling upon an unexpected success—the Phone Microwave can send emails to the past, 
                    altering the flow of history.
